## Hydrogen fuel cell simulation 

This simulation calculates the voltage and current output of a fuel cell for different flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen, and plots the results. You can customize the simulation by changing the values of the constants and parameters in the fuel_cell.jl file. For example, you can modify the electrode area, the electrode resistance, the mass transfer coefficient, the concentration of reactants, or the pressure. You can also adjust the range and number of flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen by changing the LinRange arguments for n_H2 and n_O2 in the julia script.
